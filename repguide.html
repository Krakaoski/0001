 <text> THERE ARE NO <br> USER-SERVICABLE PARTS <br> INSIDE THE FC3000&#8482 <br><br>
  THE FC3000&#8482 CANNOT BE REPAIRED </text> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  
  <p>Yes. This is a problem.<br> If you are reading this Repair Guide, then you will not be returning to the future, 
  and we apoligize for any alleged failures in the FC3000&#8482, real or implied, that facilitated this scenario.
  <br><br>
  If you would like to make peace wwith the idea that you will never return to your friends and family, please do so now. <br><br><br>
  And now that you have accepted the fact that you are stuck in the past, we would like to offer a suggestion.<br>
  Since you can no longer go back to the future...

  The rest of this Guide contains all the science, engineering, mathmatics, art, music, writing, culture, facts, and figures that are
  required for one human -without any specialized training-to build a civilization from the ground up.</p>

  We make no assumptions about what period youâ€™re trapped in or what you already know. Everything you need is built from scratch, making this text nothing less than a complete cheat sheet for civilization. <br><br>
  We at Chronotix Solutions are excited to have accidentally provided you with this opportunity, and wish you all the best.<br><br>
