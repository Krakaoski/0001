 <h1 class="outlined-text">Now We Are Become Farmers, The Devourers of Worlds</h1>
 <h2>How you too can be out standing in your field.</h2>
  <p>
  Wouldn’t it be nice if you had machines that ran on water and light and turned gross dirt into delicious food and fun chemicals?
  Also, wouldn’t it be nice if the machines were self-duplicating, self-improving, and—most exciting of all—not all of them wanted to kill you?</p>
  <p style="color:white"> Good news: these machines exist! They’re called “plants,” and they will be some of your greatest resources in your new civilization. </p>
  <p> Think of them as free technology: machines you can use, even by accident, to transform the inedible dirt around you, the boring light above you, and 
  the tedious water that falls from the sky into all sorts of useful materials, medicines, chemicals, and foods your civilization requires. If we did not already have plants, 
  we would think they are magic. But they are everywhere and evolved before we did, so most of us think they’re pretty boring.
  It took humans almost 200,000 years to realize we could do more than just gather them up when we were hungry. We could instead domesticate them, growing them in an environment 
  safer from predators, where we could be choosy, picking the plants that did more of what we wanted and less of what we didn’t.
This is called “selective breeding,” by the way, and you just invented it.
  </p> 

 <h1> Selective Breeding </h1>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> Here's What You Need To Do: </p>
   <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 1. Find a plant (or animal; this also works on animals) that has exceptional properties you like. Maybe it produces more kernels of delicious and nutritious corn than your other plants, or lasts longer in storage, or resists pests or drought, or maybe even . . . all of the above?
   </p> <br>
   <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify">2. Plant seeds from that plant instead of seeds from your other, crummier plants. (If you’re working with animals, let only the ones you like reproduce.)
   </p><br>
   <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify">3. Repeat.
   </p>
   <p>By doing this over successive seasons, you will produce crops that emphasize whatever properties you choose, almost by accident. Here are three examples of what humans have wrought with the mighty power of selective breeding alone:
   </p>
   <div class="image-container">
    <img src="suck.jpg" alt="a table">
   </div>
   <p> And these were all bred before we knew what genetics were, before we knew we could induce plants and animals to evolve for us, and before we knew that directed selective breeding could have effects within a single 
   knew that directed selective breeding could have effects within a single human lifetime. But you already know all this stuff. You’re ahead of the game already!
  </p>
  <p> There is, however, a downside to planting the same thing over and over. Rather than letting you find out by surprise and then starving to death like countless other humans have throughout time, we thought we’d tell you. Growing the same plant repeatedly will kill your soil (slowly) and then you (more quickly). Luckily, you can solve this problem with a technology called “crop rotation.” What’s “crop rotation,” you ask, as allured as you are entertained? We’re more than happy to answer.
  </p>
 <h1> Crop Rotation </h1>
  <p>There are three simple but extremely critical things to keep in mind about plants:
  </p>
  <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 1. Plants use the sun’s energy to become big and delicious.
   </p> <br>
   <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify">2. The chemical they use to extract that solar energy is called “chlorophyll.”
   </p><br>
   <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify">3. Nitrogen is a critical ingredient in chlorophyll.
   </p>
   <p style="font-size:18">It’s an oversimplification to call nitrogen “magic plant food,” but it’s not far off. It’s the most commonly supplied plant nutrient around the world</p>
   <p style="font-size:20">The good news: if you’re alive enough to read this, then Earth’s atmosphere is full of nitrogen. The bad news: plants can’t access it there. </p>
   <p style="font-size:18">Instead, they take it from the soil. And since plants remove nitrogen from soil and don’t replenish it, if you plant the same thing over and over, you will have some very, very bad problems.</p>
   <p>To avoid these problems, you need to allow the soil to recover. Unless you’ve got an extreme case, recovery is easy: just till the ground but don’t plant anything for a year (in farmer talk, this is letting the field “lie fallow”) while your animals hang out there. Tilling kills weeds, and your animals’ poop and pee are full of nitrogen, so it restores the soil</p>
   <p>So, great! Your soil will be fine, as long as you don’t mind not eating anything for a full year. And if at this point you’re thinking you could easily improve this system by 
   And if at this point you’re thinking you could easily improve this system by farming only half your fields each year while the other half recover, congratulations: you just invented crop rotation! Specifically, two-field crop rotation. It looks like this:
   </p>
   <div class="image-container" style="margin-left:170">
    <img src="t2.jpg" alt="a table">
   </div>
   
   <p>This system leaves 50 percent of your fields unproductive, but it’s simple, it’s reliable, and it lets you eat every year. But if you want to get fancier and/or want to answer people’s complaints about how nice it’d be to farm at greater than 50 percent efficiency, you can invent three-field crop rotation. It works like this:
   </p>
   <div class="image-container" style="margin-left:170">
    <img src="t3.jpg" alt="a table">
   </div>
   <p style="color:maroon">But with fields being used twice before they’re harvested, won’t the soil get exhausted?</p>
   <p>The answer lies in the legumes you were planting. Legumes are dry fruit contained within a shell or pod, and they include plants like chickpeas, regular peas, soybeans, regular beans, alfalfa, clover, lentils, and peanuts. 
   We’ve listed them out just now because you’ll definitely want to farm at least one of these bad boys! Why? Besides being reasonably tasty, legumes are one of the few plants that can host certain bacteria (called “rhizobia,” 
   though of course you can call them whatever you want) in their roots, and these bacteria do something extremely valuable, something that no plant on Earth can do on its own.
   </p>
   <p> <i>They add nitrogen back into soil.</i>
   </p>
   <p>Specifically, when rhizobia infect plants, they act as a symbiote, taking some carbon produced in the plant during photosynthesis, and in return converting nitrogen gas (N2)
   into a form plants can use (NH3, or ammonia), which is stored in the roots of that plant as nodules. And when you harvest these plants—leaving the roots in the ground—both nitrogen and rhizobia return to the soil to wait for the next planting. The legumes—or rather, the bacteria that 
   infect them—are the glue that holds this whole “three-field crop rotation” thing together.

 <h1 class="outlined-text" style="font-size:50">What Will Other Humans Be Eating If I'm Stranded After They've Evolved But Before Agriculture and Selective Breeding Are A Thing, And How Can I Tell If It's Poisonous, Because I Bet These Ancient Humans Are Eating Some Really Stupid Stuff?</h1>
 <h2>Fun Fact: You can eat ANYTHING once!</h2>
 <p>We do not know a lot about fruits and vegetables from this era (from between 200,000 BCE and 10,500 BCE)<br>
  But Here's What We Know: 
 </p>
 <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 780,000 BCE: figs, olives, and pears are being eaten. This predates even the evolution of anatomically modern humans.
 </p>
  <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 40,000 BCE: dates, legumes, and barley are being enjoyed
 </p>
  <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 30,000 BCE: apples, oranges, and wild berries are being consumed.
 </p>
  <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify"> 10,500 BCE: farming is invented, and selective breeding of plants and animals.
 </p>
 <p>As we have seen, selective breeding made plants better (from a human perspective: higher yields, bigger fruits, hardier breeds, etc.), which necessarily means the further you go back in time, the worse fruits and vegetables you’re going to find.
 Before you can start doig selective breeding, you’ll need to forage for plants and animals—both to eat and to start farms with—and you’ll probably encounter potential foods that both you and humans native to this era aren’t familiar with.
 </p>
 <text>How can you tell if they're safe to eat? </text>
 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:20;">
 Bad Answer: Eat a bunch and see if you die.<br>
 Better Answer: Eat just a little bit and see if you die.<br>
 Best Answer: Read this section and remember what you read, because there’s actually a way to eat strange foods relatively safely
 </p>
 <hr>
 <br><br>
 <text>ANIMALS</text>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
- First off: there aren’t any mammals whose flesh is naturally poisonous, so they’re generally safe to eat (food allergies aside)—but if you’re dining on platypus, maybe don’t go to town on the venom sack.<br>
- There are no birds with naturally poisonous flesh either, but there are a handful of them—like quail and the African spur-winged goose—whose flesh, skin, or even feathers can on the right diet become poisonous.
These birds can eat plants and animals toxic to humans and then incorporate those toxins into their bodies, so don’t gobble all birds willy-nilly. <br>
- It gets even dodgier when you move on to eating snakes, reptiles, fish, spiders, and dinosaurs, all of which have naturally venomous species. In fact, all spiders are technically venomous, but only a few have venom strong enough to kill you.
</p>
<text>PLANTS</text>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Plants are an even greater toxic threat than animals. Since plants can’t move like animals to escape predators, they’ve evolved several defensive strategies, many of them operating on the principle of <br>
 “I’ll make whoever’s eating me so sick that they never bother me again, but on second thought, why take the risk, better to just kill them the first time.” <br>
 Some plant toxins are irrelevant (apple seeds contain cyanide, but you’d have to eat tons of them to be affected), while others are brutally horrible. </p>
 <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify;">Among the worst is the Australian stinging bush, also known as the “suicide plant” after stories of both humans and animals killing themselves to escape the pain it produces. When you touch this plant, the neurotoxin-coated hollow hairs covering it pierce your skin, causing an unbearable pain described as similar to being burnt with acid and electrocuted at the same time, and the only treatment is to soak the affected area of your body in hydrochloric acid and then remove the plant hairs with tweezers—carefully, because if they break off inside the skin, that only increases the pain.
  <div class="image-container" style="margin-left:23%;">
    <img src="sting.jpg" alt="spikey oww" style="width:700;">
   </div>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Needless to say, you’ll want to stay away from any plants 1m to 3m tall with hairy, heart-shaped leaves ranging from 12cm to 22cm long that you find in Australia. Luckily, you can put any food, whether plant or animal, to the Universal Edibility Test. Before submitting a new food to the test, make sure to have lots of water nearby (fresh and salted), and some charcoal. <br>
The fresh water is for drinking and to clean affected areas of your skin, lips, or tongue if something bad happens, the saltwater is to induce vomiting if something bad happens inside you, and a teaspoon of charcoal can be mixed with the water to produce a paste that will either induce vomiting when swallowed or, if you can keep it down, help absorb toxins. Bon appétit!
</p>
 
   <h2 style="color: white; font-size:30;">Universal Edibility Test</h2>
 <p class="text-container" style="text-align:justify; color:white;">
   - Test each part of a potential food separately (seeds, stem, leaves, buds, fruit, etc.), and in the same state you intend to eat it in (raw or cooked). Cooked is always safer. Don’t eat for eight hours before each test, and remember that testing just a single part of a single potential food will take the better part of an entire day. To save yourself from wasting time eating poisons, remember that bright colors are usually (but not always) used in nature to mean “I’m easily seen, which means I’m not worried about predators, which means if you eat me you’re probably going to have a bad time.”<br>
   1.Smell the food: a strong, unpleasant smell is usually a bad sign. Don’t eat it if it smells rotten—because it probably is—and if your food smells like almonds but is not, in fact, almonds, it might contain cyanide. <br>
   2. The skin inside your elbow or wrist is sensitive: gently rub a piece of the food there and wait 15 minutes. If your skin burns, itches, goes numb, or reacts in any way, don’t eat it.<br>
   3. If nothing bad happens, briefly touch the food to the corner of your mouth, then wait 15 minutes.<br>
   4. If nothing bad happens, briefly touch it to your lip and tongue, and wait another 15 minutes.<br>
   5. If nothing bad happens, place a piece on your tongue and wait with it in your mouth for, you guessed it, 15 minutes.<br>
   6. If nothing bad happens, chew it once, but don’t swallow. Hold it in your mouth for 15 minutes.<br>
   7. If nothing bad happens, swallow the piece you chewed 15 minutes ago, and consume nothing but water for the next 8 hours.<br>
   8. If nothing bad happens, eat a small handful of the food and wait another 8 hours.<br>
   9. If you’ve gotten this far without any reaction, the food is probably safe to eat! You can add it to your diet slowly over the next week.<br>
  -  This whole process takes seventeen and a half hours, and you can’t eat anything else during the test, but it is a viable way to experiment with new foods and also not die! And while it’s not perfect—a rash from poison ivy, for example, can sometimes take days to manifest—it does limit your exposure.<br>
